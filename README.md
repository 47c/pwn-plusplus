a fully featured <a href="https://www.pwnadventure.com/">pwn adventure 3</a> internal cheat
</p>

## about
small project i've done as an exercise with a couple of friends, where each had their own project with their own approach for fun and profit

as it stands, the project is inactive and unfinished, however quite a bit of progress has been made and could be used as a resource for others who want to work on their own projects

## what is pwn adventure?
pwn adventure 3 is the second installment in the ghost in the shellcode pwn adventure ctf series

the game was essentially built using unreal engine 4 to showcase game development vulnerabilities and assist users in developing exploits for it

pwn++ branches out from the main goal of pwn adventure since the focus isn't solely on completing all of the game's achievements, but also exploiting other game mechanics and ultimately building a pvp-focused cheat for competing with other cheats
